# DiscNoise

The package enables the automated implementation of the framework proposed in our paper titled "Impact of Discretization Noise on Machine
Learning Classifiers when Studying Software Engineering Datasets". 

The framework provides an automated way to analyze the impact of discretization noise on the performance and feature importance of a classifier.

Kindly refer to our paper for more details!

Our package can be installed with ```devtools::install_github('rgopikrishnan91/DiscNoise')```
